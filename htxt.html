    One's website is placed on the same server as many other sites, ranging from a few sites to hundreds of websites.
    Typically, all domains may share a common pool of server resources, such as RAM and the CPU. The features available with this type of service can be quite basic and not flexible in terms of software and updates.
    Resellers often sell shared web hosting and web companies often have reseller accounts to provide hosting for clients.</p>
